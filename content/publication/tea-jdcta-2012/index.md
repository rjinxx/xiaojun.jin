abstract: 'Background: Pathological tau is spread along anatomically connected networks,
  originating in areas containing particularly vulnerable cell populations. It is
  hypothesized that tau is released and spread as free tau, or via extracellular vesicles
  (EVs) that include exosomes (30-150 nm), microvesicles (100-1000 nm), and apoptotic
  bodies (1000-5000 nM). While a variety of different EV tau species have been identified
  in tissue, cells, and bio-fluids, EV tau has not yet been described from human post-mortem
  tauopathy brain tissue.'
