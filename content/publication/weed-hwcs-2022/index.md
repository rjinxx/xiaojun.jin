abstract: 'Precision spraying of postemergence herbicides according to the herbicide weed control spectrum can substantially reduce herbicide input. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for detecting and discriminating weeds growing in turfgrass based on their susceptibility to ACCase-inhibiting and synthetic auxin herbicides. GoogLeNet, MobileNet-v3, ShuffleNet-v2, and VGGNet were trained to discriminate the vegetation into three categories based on the herbicide weed control spectrum: weeds susceptible to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides, weeds susceptible to synthetic auxin herbicides, and turfgrass without weed infestation (no herbicide). ShuffleNet-v2 and VGGNet showed high overall accuracy (≥ 0.999) and F1 scores (≥ 0.998) in the validation and testing datasets to detect and discriminate weeds susceptible to ACCase-inhibiting and synthetic auxin herbicides. The inference time of ShuffleNet-v2 was similar to MobileNet-v3, but noticeably faster than GoogLeNet and VGGNet. ShuffleNet-v2 was the most efficient and reliable model among the neural networks evaluated. These results demonstrated that the DCNNs trained based on the herbicide weed control spectrum could detect and discriminate weeds based on their susceptibility to selective herbicides, allowing the precision spraying of particular herbicides to susceptible weeds and thereby saving more herbicides. The proposed method can be used in a machine vision-based autonomous spot-spraying system of smart sprayers.'

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: ShuffleNet-v2 presented a superiority in discriminating weeds based on their susceptibility to herbicides compared to when it was used to detect and discriminate individual weed species. Effective discrimination of weed species based on the herbicide weed control spectrum allows the smart sprayer to spray particular herbicides to control the susceptible weeds, thereby saving more herbicides.
