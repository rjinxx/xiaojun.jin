abstract: 'In-field weed detection in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is challenging due to the occurrence of weeds in close proximity with the crop. The objective of this research was to evaluate the feasibility of using deep convolutional neural networks for detecting broadleaf weed seedlings growing in wheat.'

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: CenterNet, Faster R-CNN, TridentNet, VFNet, and YOLOv3 were insufficient, while AlexNet, DenseNet, ResNet, and VGGNet trained with a large training dataset were highly effective for detection of broadleaf weed seedlings in wheat.
